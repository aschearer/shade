Shade -- A casual 2d game written in Java
    http://github.com/aschearer/shade/wikis

An ant file is included with this project. To get up and running please
follow these instructions.

Building Shade:

    ant build // compiles source code and creates shade.jar

Running Shade:

    ant run // executes shade.jar with necessary arguments

Cleaning:

    ant clean // removes bin/, webstart/, and shade.jar

Deploying Shade:

    ant webstart // creates a webstart to deploy to a server

This last one warrants some explanation. If you want to create a webstart
to host Shade on your website then you need to provide the url for your
server as well as a username and password to sign shade.jar. 

This will create a directory, webstart/, which contains all the necessary
files. Simply upload webstart/ to your server and navigate to:
